        </br><h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hi, I’m Phillip. My friends used to call me Phil, but I don’t like that. In fact… Everyone I met would call me Phil. It got so bad that I stopped going outside. After six long months in complete solitude, I decided it was time for a change. So, I created this place… Kittenville. You see, I can’t have any kittens of my own because they give me asthma, hypertension and constant panic attacks. Real kittens are a lot of work and they jump off of everything. It’s amazing that I’ve been able to procure such a collection of images featuring kittens that haven’t yet plunged to their deaths.</br></br>

            Curating kitten pictures has always been a hobby of mine. Or at least it was before I quit my job and maxed out all of my credit cards on scrapbooking materials and bookshelves. My SNAP benefits wouldn’t cover such necessities and I ended up in a really dark place. That was of course, before the new neighbors moved in. Thanks to their unprotected WiFi network, I can finally continue doing what I love.</br></br>
            
            I decided to create Kittenville so that my collection of kitten pictures could be shared by other feline photo enthusiasts. It’s been an overwhelming experience so far and I’ve only just begun my digital collection. The internet is pretty big and there must be like…  a hundred dozen cat pictures on the world wide web. It’s my privilege to find the best ones and keep them here where they belong… Kittenville.
